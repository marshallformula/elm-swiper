-}

    , clientY : Float

{-| This event is either a "touchstart" or "touchend" event. You don't need to worry about which -
just need to hang on to it so you can pass it back to a "hasSwipedXXX" function.

-}

{-| Since there is no actual "swipe" event - the detection of a swipe is determined by evaluating the coordinates of "touchstart" and "touchend" events. This means some "state" must be stored by the application between events. That state is encapsulated in _SwipingState_. Store this so it can be passed to a hasSwipedXXX function.

Returns a tuple with the new SwipingState and the Bool answer.

It returns a list of Attributes (it must be a list because it can fire both "touchstart" and "touchend" states)
